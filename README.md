# BlackSilk-Blockchain

## Overview

BlackSilk-Blockchain is a next-generation, fully node-driven blockchain platform for decentralized applications, digital asset tokenization, and secure peer-to-peer commerce. All features are powered by on-chain dataâ€”no hardcoded or placeholder logicâ€”ensuring transparency, auditability, and trust. The platform includes:
- A Rust-based blockchain node with advanced consensus and privacy.
- Smart contracts for escrow, marketplace, auctions, reviews, and multi-sig.
- Tokenization (fungible, NFT, and standards-compliant assets).
- Developer-friendly APIs, monitoring, and cross-chain capabilities.
- A decentralized marketplace with live, node-driven data.
- Full privacy stack (I2P), robust monitoring, and mainnet readiness.

## Features

### Blockchain Core
- **Rust Node**: Secure, performant, modular. Supports P2P, block production, and transaction processing.
- **Consensus**: Pluggable (PoW/PoS hybrid, see Tokenomics).
- **Privacy**: I2P integration for anonymous networking.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, custom exporter, and alerting.

### Smart Contracts
- **Escrow Contract**: Multi-party, multi-sig, standards-compliant. Supports dispute resolution and trait-based interfaces (`MultiSigEscrow`).
- **Marketplace Contract**: On-chain product listings, auctions, reviews, and bidding. Implements `Reviewable`, `Auctionable` traits.
- **Tokenization**: Native support for fungible tokens (FT), NFTs, and custom asset standards (ERC20/721/1155-like, see Tokenomics).
- **Trait-based Interfaces**: Extensible contract traits for composability and future standards.

### Decentralized Marketplace
- **Frontend**: Next.js/TypeScript, live data from blockchain node (no mock data).
- **Backend**: Rust, exposes all product/order data as on-chain transaction metadata.
- **Features**: List, buy, sell, bid, review, dispute, and manage ordersâ€”all on-chain.
- **User Dashboard**: Real-time order, product, and review management.

### Wallets
- **Web Wallet**: Next.js, supports native and token assets, contract interactions, and DApp connections.
- **CLI Wallet**: Rust, for advanced users and automation.

### Block Explorer
- **Next.js**: Real-time blockchain data, contract and token analytics, address/transaction search, and smart contract UI.

### Tokenomics & Asset Support
- **Fungible Tokens**: Native and user-defined, with supply, emission, and standards.
- **NFTs**: On-chain, standard-compliant, with metadata and marketplace integration.
- **Consensus**: Hybrid PoW/PoS (configurable), with emission schedule and staking.
- **Governance Token**: (Planned) for on-chain voting and protocol upgrades.

### Developer Tooling
- **APIs**: REST/GraphQL endpoints for node, contracts, and marketplace.
- **SDKs**: (Planned) for Rust, TypeScript, and cross-chain integration.
- **Documentation**: Full API and contract interface docs.

### Cross-Chain & Interoperability
- **Bridges**: (Planned) for asset and data transfer to/from other blockchains.
- **Standards**: ERC20/721/1155-like, plus custom traits for future-proofing.

### Monitoring & Operations
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Node, contract, and marketplace metrics.
- **Alertmanager**: Custom rules for uptime, performance, and security.
- **Dockerized**: Full stack deployable via Docker Compose.

### Privacy & Security
- **I2P**: Optional, for all node and wallet communications.
- **Multi-Sig**: Escrow and contract-level multi-signature support.
- **Audits**: (Ongoing) for core, contracts, and cryptography.

## Tokenomics

- **Native Token**: $BSK (BlackSilk Token)
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 BSK (configurable at genesis)
- **Emission**: Block rewards (PoW/PoS), staking, and governance incentives
- **Consensus**: Hybrid PoW/PoS (configurable, see `chain_spec.json`)
- **Token Standards**: Native FT, NFT, and custom asset standards (ERC20/721/1155-like)
- **Staking**: PoS validators earn rewards, participate in governance
- **Governance**: (Planned) On-chain voting, protocol upgrades, and treasury
- **Marketplace Fees**: Paid in BSK, distributed to validators and treasury
- **Cross-Chain**: (Planned) Asset bridges and wrapped tokens

## API & Smart Contract Interfaces

### Marketplace API (Node-Driven, TypeScript)
- `getProducts()`: Fetch all products (on-chain)
- `getProductById(id)`: Fetch product details (on-chain)
- `createProduct(data)`: List new product (on-chain tx)
- `placeBid(productId, amount)`: Place auction bid (on-chain)
- `submitReview(productId, review)`: Submit review (on-chain)
- `getOrders(userId)`: Fetch user orders (on-chain)
- `createOrder(productId, buyer)`: Place order (on-chain)
- All endpoints interact with the blockchain node, no mock data

### Smart Contract Traits
- `Reviewable`: Add/fetch on-chain reviews
- `Auctionable`: Auction logic, bidding, settlement
- `MultiSigEscrow`: Multi-party escrow, dispute resolution
- `TokenStandard`: FT/NFT minting, transfer, and metadata
