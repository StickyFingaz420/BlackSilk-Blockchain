# CryptoNote-style Ring Signature Verification (Minimal)

This module provides a minimal implementation of CryptoNote/Monero-style ring signature verification using curve25519-dalek. It is designed for educational and prototyping purposes only.

## Features
- MLSAG-style ring signature verification (single key image, one-time ring, no linkability)
- Uses curve25519-dalek for elliptic curve operations
- No external dependencies beyond curve25519-dalek and sha2

## Usage
- Integrate with the node's `validate_ring_signature` function
- Accepts a ring of public keys, a signature, and a message

## Limitations
- Not production secure
- No support for multi-layer/multi-base ring signatures
- No linkability or advanced features
