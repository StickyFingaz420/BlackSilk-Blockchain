# Mutation exemptions

Status: the register of **equivalent mutants** in consensus code: code changes a
mutation tool reports as surviving, because no input can observe them. The freeze gate
of decisions "Agent 42" allows zero unexplained survivors in `consensus` and `px-core`;
an entry here is the written explanation, with its proof or its evidence and the
command that reproduces it. Internal engineering work, not an audit. An exemption
never covers a mutant of a reachable rule: those need a test.

Each entry names: the code, the mutants covered, the argument, the evidence, and the
record that decided it.

## E1: the LWMA weighted-sum floor `n²T/20` (consensus/src/difficulty.rs)

Decision: decisions "RT-FP3" (RTFP3-16). Record:
[v3-consensus-changes.md](v3-consensus-changes.md) `fingerprint-v3`, Follow-up (RT-FP3).

**Code.** In `next_difficulty`, after the weighted sum of the window's solve times:
`weighted = weighted.max(n * n * t / 20).max(1);`. The rule id
`lwma1-n75-step-t/2-warm11-cap6t-floor20` names the floor, and it stays as a documented
defensive floor: the rule id is unchanged.

**Argument (the floor never binds).** Let `n` be the window's solve-time count
(1 ≤ n ≤ 75) and `step = max(1, ⌊T/2⌋)`. The counted clock gives each block
`this = max(ts, prev + step)`, so every counted solve time `this − prev` is at least
`step`, and the 6T cap keeps it at least `min(step, 6T) = step` (as `step ≤ T/2 < 6T`
for T ≥ 2, and `step = 1 ≤ 6` for T = 1). Hence

  weighted = Σ i · solve_i ≥ step · n(n + 1)/2 =: LB(n, T).

For T ≥ 2, `step ≥ (T − 1)/2 ≥ T/4`, so LB ≥ n(n + 1)T/8 > n²T/20 ≥ ⌊n²T/20⌋. For
T = 1, LB = n(n + 1)/2 ≥ n²/20. So `weighted ≥ ⌊n²T/20⌋` on every input, the first
`max` returns `weighted`, and for n ≥ 1 the second `max(1)` returns it too (LB ≥ 1).
The floor is unreachable for every T ≥ 1. `ChainParams::check` requires T ≥ 2; testnet
and mainnet have T = 120, regtest T = 10.

**Mutants covered** (equivalent by this argument): any mutant of the floor term whose
value never exceeds LB(n, T). Checked exhaustively for n = 1..75 with this standard-
library Python (FX-RTFP3, 2026-09-29), for each mutant `f`:

```python
step = lambda t: max(1, t // 2)
lb = lambda n, t: step(t) * n * (n + 1) // 2
binds = lambda f, ts: next(((n, t) for t in ts for n in range(1, 76) if f(n, t) > lb(n, t)), None)
# e.g. binds(lambda n, t: n * n * t // 20, range(1, 100_001)) is None
```

Results:

| Mutant of `n * n * t / 20` | T = 120 (testnet, mainnet) | T = 10 (regtest) | Every T in 2..=100 000 |
|---|---|---|---|
| the rule itself | never binds | never binds | never binds |
| `/ 19`, `/ 21` | never binds | never binds | never binds |
| `n + n * t / 20`, `n / n * t / 20`, `n * n / t / 20` | never binds | never binds | never binds |
| the floor removed (0), or only `.max(1)` | never binds | never binds | never binds |
| `n * n + t / 20` | never binds | never binds | binds (n = 2, T = 2) |
| `% 20` | never binds | **binds** (n = 1) | binds |
| `* 20` | **binds** (n = 1) | **binds** (n = 1) | binds |

**Exempt:** the first four rows, on every valid parameter set; and `n * n + t / 20`
on the built-in networks only (a network with T = 2 would observe it: record it here
before adding one). **Not exempt**, they need killing tests: `% 20` (regtest observes
it) and `* 20`. Under `* 20` an on-target window of 75 blocks at T = 120 has a floor of
20·75²·120 = 13 500 000, about 39 times its weighted sum 120·75·76/2 = 342 000, so any
on-target vector (for example the steady case of `rules.sample.next_difficulty`,
1 000 000) changes.

**Consequence for the fingerprint.** The rule samples (`rules.sample.next_difficulty`)
cannot tell the floor's equivalent mutants apart, by construction: no input can. The
rule id in the manifest names the floor.
