# BlackSilk Blockchain Security Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the security architecture and design decisions implemented in the BlackSilk blockchain.

## Core Security Components

### Cryptographic Foundations
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256 for block hashing
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for transaction signing
- **Private Transactions**: Zero-knowledge proofs implementation
- **Mining Algorithm**: RandomX for ASIC resistance

### Network Security
- **P2P Protocol**: Secure node communication
- **Node Authentication**: Cryptographic node identity
- **Message Encryption**: End-to-end encrypted communications
- **DoS Protection**: Rate limiting and connection management

### Consensus Security
- **Proof of Work**: Modified PoW with privacy features
- **Block Validation**: Multi-layer validation process
- **Chain Reorganization**: Deep reorg protection
- **Finality**: Practical finality mechanisms

### Privacy Protection
- **Transaction Privacy**: Optional private transactions
- **Address Privacy**: Stealth address support
- **Amount Privacy**: Confidential transactions
- **Metadata Privacy**: Timing and pattern obfuscation

## Security Assumptions

### Trust Model
- Honest majority assumption
- Network partition resistance
- Byzantine fault tolerance considerations

### Threat Model
- External attackers
- Malicious miners
- Network-level attacks
- Implementation vulnerabilities

## Security Controls

### Input Validation
- Transaction format validation
- Block structure validation
- Network message validation
- API input sanitization

### Access Control
- Node permission management
- API authentication
- Admin interface protection
- Wallet access control

### Monitoring and Logging
- Security event logging
- Anomaly detection
- Performance monitoring
- Incident response preparation

## Known Limitations
- Early development stage risks
- Limited real-world testing
- Dependency on external libraries
- Network effect requirements

## Recommendations
- Regular security audits
- Continuous monitoring
- Incident response planning
- Community security reporting
