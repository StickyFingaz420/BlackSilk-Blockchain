## Overview

BlackSilk operates under a **hybrid governance model** that combines:

- **Meritocratic development** by core contributors
- **Community consensus** for major decisions
- **On-chain voting** for protocol parameters
- **Off-chain discussion** for complex proposals

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency**: All decisions and processes are publicly documented
2. **Inclusivity**: Community members can participate regardless of technical expertise
3. **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the protocol
4. **Security**: Changes undergo rigorous review and testing
5. **Sustainability**: Long-term viability takes precedence over short-term gains

## Governance Principles

### 1. Progressive Decentralization

BlackSilk follows a path toward increasing decentralization:

- **Phase 1** (Current): Core team leadership with community input
- **Phase 2** (Testnet): Community advisory council formation
- **Phase 3** (Mainnet): Full on-chain governance implementation
- **Phase 4** (Mature): Community-driven protocol evolution

### 2. Stakeholder Representation

Key stakeholders in BlackSilk governance:

- **Developers**: Core contributors and community developers
- **Miners**: Network security providers using RandomX
- **Users**: Wallet users and marketplace participants
- **Validators**: Node operators maintaining network integrity
- **Community**: Broader ecosystem participants

### 3. Consensus Requirements

Different types of decisions require different consensus thresholds:

| Decision Type | Required Consensus | Process |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Bug Fixes** | Core team approval | Standard development |
| **Minor Features** | Community discussion + Core approval | BIP process |
| **Major Features** | Community vote + 60% approval | Extended BIP process |
| **Protocol Changes** | On-chain vote + 67% approval | Hard fork process |
| **Economic Parameters** | On-chain vote + 75% approval | Critical upgrade process |

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. BlackSilk Improvement Proposals (BIPs)

All significant changes follow the BIP process:

#### BIP Types

- **Standards Track**: Protocol specifications and changes
- **Informational**: Design issues and guidelines  
- **Process**: Governance and development processes

#### BIP Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial proposal submission
2. **Discussion**: Community review period (minimum 2 weeks)
3. **Review**: Technical review by core developers
4. **Voting**: Community and/or on-chain voting
5. **Final**: Approved and ready for implementation
6. **Implemented**: Live on testnet/mainnet

#### BIP Template

```markdown

### 2. Discussion Forums

Official channels for governance discussion:

- **GitHub Discussions**: Technical proposals and code reviews
- **Discord #governance**: Real-time community discussion
- **Forum**: Long-form proposals and debates (coming soon)
- **Telegram**: Informal community chat

### 3. Review Process

#### Technical Review

Core developers review proposals for:
- Technical feasibility
- Security implications
- Implementation complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Compatibility impact

#### Community Review

Community evaluates proposals based on:
- User impact and benefits
- Economic implications
- Ecosystem effects
- Alignment with project goals

## Protocol Upgrade Process

### 1. Upgrade Types

#### Soft Forks
- **Definition**: Backward-compatible protocol tightening
- **Examples**: New validation rules, privacy enhancements
- **Activation**: Miner signaling + economic nodes
- **Threshold**: 67% miner activation over 2016 blocks

#### Hard Forks
- **Definition**: Protocol changes requiring all nodes to upgrade
- **Examples**: Block size changes, consensus algorithm updates
- **Activation**: Coordinated upgrade at specific block height
- **Threshold**: 75% community consensus + 6-month notice

### 2. Upgrade Procedure

#### Phase 1: Proposal
1. BIP submission with technical specification
2. Reference implementation development
3. Testnet deployment and testing
4. Security audit completion

#### Phase 2: Discussion
1. Community discussion period (minimum 3 months for hard forks)
2. Technical review and feedback incorporation
3. Economic analysis and impact assessment
4. Stakeholder feedback collection

#### Phase 3: Voting
1. Governance vote initiation
2. Voting period (2-4 weeks depending on change type)
3. Results analysis and verification
4. Implementation planning

#### Phase 4: Implementation
1. Final code review and testing
2. Release preparation and documentation
3. Coordinated upgrade announcement
4. Network upgrade execution

### 3. Emergency Procedures

For critical security issues:

1. **Immediate Response**: Core team can implement emergency fixes
2. **Notification**: Community notification within 24 hours
3. **Retroactive Approval**: Community vote within 30 days
4. **Transparency**: Full disclosure after fix deployment

## Community Participation

### 1. How to Participate

Anyone can participate in BlackSilk governance:

#### For Developers
- Submit BIPs for protocol improvements
- Contribute to reference implementation
- Review and test proposed changes
- Participate in technical discussions

#### For Users
- Vote on governance proposals
- Provide feedback on user experience
- Test features on testnet
- Participate in community discussions

#### For Miners/Validators
- Signal support for protocol upgrades
- Provide network security and decentralization
- Participate in consensus decisions
- Report network issues and concerns

### 2. Governance Tokens

**Current State**: No governance tokens (development phase)

**Future Implementation**: 
- On-chain voting system using staked BLK
- Voting power proportional to stake duration
- Minimum stake requirements for proposal submission
- Delegation support for liquid democracy

### 3. Community Council

**Formation**: After testnet stabilization

**Composition**:
- 3 Core developers (elected by development team)
- 3 Community representatives (elected by BLK holders)
- 2 Mining representatives (elected by miners)
- 1 Security expert (appointed by council)

**Responsibilities**:
- Review and prioritize BIPs
- Coordinate major upgrades
- Resolve governance disputes
- Represent community interests

## Voting Mechanisms

### 1. Off-Chain Voting (Current)

During development and testnet phases:

- **Platform**: GitHub Discussions + Discord polls
- **Eligibility**: Active community members
- **Duration**: 1-4 weeks depending on proposal
- **Threshold**: Simple majority for advisory votes

### 2. On-Chain Voting (Future)

For mainnet governance:

#### Voting Power Calculation
```
Voting Power = Staked BLK × Time Lock Multiplier
```

#### Time Lock Multipliers
- 1 month: 1.0x
- 3 months: 1.5x  
- 6 months: 2.0x
- 1 year: 3.0x
- 2 years: 4.0x

#### Proposal Requirements
- **Minimum Stake**: 10,000 BLK to submit proposal
- **Support Threshold**: 1% of total supply to proceed to vote
- **Quorum**: 10% of circulating supply must participate
- **Passing Threshold**: 50-75% depending on proposal type

### 3. Quadratic Voting

For certain community decisions:

- Prevents plutocracy by reducing large holder influence
- Cost = (Number of votes)²
- Encourages broader participation
- Used for non-binding community polls
